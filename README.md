# Ctvlib

This is an extraction of the CTV library I created for the [CTV Playground](https://ctv.ursus.camp).

## Installation

It is not currently available on crates.io. Install it by adding it as a git depencency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
ctvlib = { git = "https://github.com/ursuscamp/ctvlib" }
```

Run `cargo doc --open` to read the docs directly.

## Warning

This library is currently unstable. If you use it, I suggest depending on a specific commit to avoid breakage for API changes.
